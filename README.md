# AI Sign Language Generator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI tool that transforms text into sign language. By encoding every word in the sign language lexicon, a video is generated that interprets the text in sign language.

## Background

There are millions of deaf and hard of hearing individuals worldwide who use sign language to communicate. Being able to transform written text into sign language would make information more accessible for these individuals. This solution has the potential to assist people in understanding information on websites, in books, documents, emails, and more.

## How is it used?

The user would input text, and the AI system would then generate a video with an person or avatar showing the sign language interpretation of the text. This would be useful in many different contexts, including education, communication, and web accessibility. Users would include deaf and hard of hearing individuals, their families, educators, and more.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data for this project would come from sign language lexicons and video examples of sign language. AI techniques that could be used include natural language processing (NLP) to analyze and interpret the input text, and machine learning to associate words with their corresponding sign language signs.

## Challenges

One challenge with this project would be that there are many different types of sign language around the world, so a solution that works for one sign language may not work for another. Additionally, the same sign language sign can mean different things depending on context, which would require more advanced AI to understand and interpret correctly.

## What next?

There is potential to expand this project to support more sign languages and to turn it into a mobile app or web platform. To accomplish this, we would need to collect more data and possibly collaborate with linguists and sign language experts.

## Acknowledgments

This project would not be possible without the extensive work done by linguists and sign language researchers to document and catalog sign language. We would also need to use open-source machine learning and NLP libraries to develop the AI components of the project.
